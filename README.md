I was under the assumption I would just made a pdf or something, but this will work.

WARNING: WHEN TESTING CODE, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING PYTHON 3. 
TYPE "python3 RPG" IN THE TERMINAL WHILE INSIDE THE SAME FOLDER AS THE RPG REPO TO MAKE CODE WORK.

Now that you have my code working, here was my original proposal in all its typified glory. Yes I copied and pasted it.
No, I did not copy and paste this text here. This work is original right up to the quotation marks, which I use for
demonstrative purposes. The original proposal went like this...

"Despite the endless possibilities statistic-based storytelling and computer simulation has to offer, most game companies gravitate toward the almost barbaric formula of kill-monsters-get-power dynamic to the point where it makes games habit-forming. These days, the computer game industry has churned out countless titles, usually with built in RPG mechanics similar to the ones above, whose grinding mechanics amount to little more then point-and-click. They get away with this mostly by making their rewards temporary, semi-consistent, and indirectly empowering. These are the building blocks of operant conditioning, which can easily be the baseline of a bad habit.  
	The project proposed here is that of a text-based RPG that deconstructs the genre as a whole, exposing all its bad habits and how they actually lend less towards imaginative escape and more toward detachment. The game would operate much like a digital version of a Tabletop RPG, complete with a GM object telling the player character what to do, and character objects that represent both the players character and the GM's monsters respectively. It wouldn't just cover the traditional fantasy, or sci-fi genres though; it would coalesce as the player continues the game into a kaleidoscope of genres that cover most of pop culture, ending climatically with the one genre every person is familiar with; the genre of real life. This will mostly be done with text, decision trees, and objects that simulate the RPG experience that follows the “traditional” formula each time, but in a different style with each new play through. The game will operate on a loop, asking the player each time the game begins what genre they want.
	The choices are mostly what you expect at first; Fantasy, Science Fiction, and an action-oriented horror. After the first round of play, you get other options; Romance, Kung Fu, Steampunk, CyberPunk, Slasher Movie Horror, Mystery thriller, and so on. These genres will be little more then texts that describe the same kind of gameplay developed, albeit with different narrative text. The final genre to “unlock” will be that of real life, in which the player character is a typical office working geek who does mundane tasks using the same system utilized to fight monsters. This would be the point the game makes; no matter how you dress a game up, grind mechanics are still grind mechanics. If your game can't differentiate between typing a spreadsheet and slaying a dragon, then neither will your player. Thus the project is an experiment in engagement, as well as a statement on the gaming industry as a whole."
  
  That was when I first started coding this monstrosity, starry eyed and completely naive. I am one month older and wiser now, and had to cut a few features.
  
  One feature I cut was the genre swapping. As per your reccomendation, I made it one story with one genre. Glad I did btw, thank you! Also was not able to allow the player to level up, due mostly to work overload and time constraints. There is a LOT of unused code in these files, and not every feature made it into the final product. What you have left is an... okay text based RPG that gets its point across, albiet with less interactivity then you would expect from a full fledged text-based RPG.
  
  In the future, I would like to make a better and more modular game loop, more items and monsters to fight, and a chance to do some actual level grinding. Sadly, this is one thing you don't get to explore in this game.
  
  Oh well. Maybe next project.
