# Comments
You had really good descriptive comments in the two module files that gave not just the what but the why of each piece. The main module gave a good sense of the control flow, but the comments there tended to be a bit more colorful than informative.

# Code Quality
I know you came in with knowledge, ideas and a certain amount of this code already written, but this was still an impressive project given the relatively short amount of time you had to complete it. The code was DRY and appropriately encapsulated, and the writing in the game was good as well.

# Ambition
Similar to the above Code Quality comments, this was an ambitious project that was largely realized. Great work.
